# EventNet
A open source social networking website built for my second year WebScript unit

## Install instructions

You must run the server on port 8080 for user login to work.

## Client instructions

On any clients connecting to EventNet, either run update_hosts.sh or update_hosts.cmd in administrator mode and enter the ip address of the server running eventnet to allow the client to redirect evetnet.com to the server. Without this you will not be able to log in.
