      <h2>Current State</h2>
      <p>This product allows users to join 'events' which allow them to post content, comment on content and message other users on the same network.</p>
      <p>Users can search for content on the site using the search box. This has a very simplistic search functionality which bases the results purely on content matching. It does not then sort the results by any other factor such as number of comments,
        this was done as this was deemed an additional and no critical funciton and was set aside in favor of implementing more critical functionality.</p>
      <p>Clients recieve an acces token from the server, which is used to identify the user. This does not allow the user to log out of all locations, nor does it provide any sort of authentication for users, such as checking if they are allowed to post
        ect. This functionality was not implemented as it seemed out of scope for this project.</p>
      <p>Clients are not able to log in via any other OAuth service other than Google. Other services were not added as they were not required and were not deemed nessisary.</p>
